# Brain_tumor_prediction
This project develops an AI-based system to predict brain tumor risk using MRI scans and patient data. Unlike traditional methods, it provides a probability score (e.g., 70% risk). Using the BraTS dataset and synthetic factors, it aims to support early diagnosis and better outcomes.
